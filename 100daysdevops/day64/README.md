This task involved troubleshooting and fixing a misconfigured Kubernetes deployment for a **Python Flask web application**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Fix Summary

### üß† Problem 1: Invalid Image
The image name was wrongly mentioned in both pod and deployment configuration. Rectify image name from pod and deployment configuration.

### üß† Problem 2: Invalid Port
The service port: 8080 and targetPort: 8080
nodePort: 32345 but this is a flax app that port and target Port is 5000.
So edit the service configuration and make the port and target port 5000 instead of 8080.
